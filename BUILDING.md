# Building Logistics Pipes

If you are familiar with Minecraft Forge and Gradle or you are a Java developer
you should not have many problems starting with Logistics Pipes and your IDE.
But we have some required steps that you need to follow to make things work.

## Prerequisites

1. Having [git](http://git-scm.com/) installed
2. Having an IDE (we do use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))
3. Having [Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/) installed with your IDE (in
IntelliJ IDEA there is a plugin for Lombok which requires annotation processing
to be enabled)
4. Matrix/Discord wouldn't be bad if you want to communicate with other
   contributors and us.

## Matrix

[Dev Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#logisticspipes+dev:rs485.network)

[LP Community](https://matrix.to/#/+logisticspipes:rs485.network)

The channels are all linked to Discord and some even to IRC.

## Setting Up

### git

First off you need to clone Logistics Pipes from GitHub of course. If you only
want to browse the source, you can clone the official repository. But it is best
practice to actually fork the repository and clone your own copy.

The git command line is `git clone https://github.com/RS485/LogisticsPipes.git`
where you can replace RS485 by your own user name, **if** you forked the
repository.

### Development environment

[Here is a video](https://streamable.com/a2cjb) that shows how to set up your
repository and development environment with the prerequisites above.
